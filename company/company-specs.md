# What Is Value-Based Strategy?

Crafting a winning business strategy is all about developing, aligning, and integrating your organization's strategic initiatives to gain a competitive edge in the market. A well-devised business strategy not only provides a clear roadmap for achieving your goals but also ensures your organization can survive and thrive in a dynamic marketplace.

One effective approach is the value-based strategy. This method simplifies strategic planning by using the value stick framework, which hones in on the unique advantages your business offers, making it easier to focus on what truly sets you apart from the competition.

Value-based strategy is a dynamic method where price-setting and resouce allocation is based on the perceived value of the good or service. This approach ensures that prices reflect what customers believe the product or service is worth.

To visualize and optimize this strategy, the value stick framework is invaluable. It helps you see how different factors interact and guides you in choosing initiatives that maximize value for everyone involved.

**The Value Stick Framework**

The value stick consists of four key factors:

1. **Willingness to Pay (WTP):** The highest price a customer is willing to pay for your product or service.
2. **Price:** The actual amount customers pay for your goods or services.
3. **Cost:** The expenses incurred by the company to produce the goods or services.
4. **Willingness to Sell (WTS):** The minimum amount suppliers are willing to accept for the materials needed to produce your goods or services.

By adjusting each factor on the value stick, you can see how it impacts the others and find the optimal way to create value. For example, lowering the price can boost customer satisfaction and increase demand. The core questions for strategists are:
- “How can my business best create value for customers?
- How can my business create value for employees?
- How can my business create value by collaborating with suppliers?

Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial for identifying opportunities and differentiating your services. Here’s an analysis of the market and the positioning of our key competitors:

### Competitor Analysis

- **Cognizant**: This company provides comprehensive IT and business process outsourcing services. Although they have a diverse portfolio, their services tend to be less customizable and more expensive, making them less accessible to SMEs.
- **Deloitte**: A major player in professional services, Deloitte offers extensive outsourcing and consulting services, including IT, HR, and finance. Their services are often tailored to large enterprises, which can make them less accessible to SMEs.
- **HCL Technologies**: Specializes in IT services and solutions, with a strong emphasis on innovation and technology. Despite their strengths, HCL's focus remains on larger corporations, with less emphasis on the unique needs of SMEs.
- **Infosys**: Known for its IT outsourcing and consulting services, Infosys caters to a wide range of industries. While they provide high-quality services, their offerings are typically geared towards larger organizations, leaving a gap for SME-focused solutions.
- **Tata Consultancy**: Provides a wide range of IT services and solutions. TCS is known for its large-scale projects and comprehensive service offerings, but their primary focus on large enterprises often leaves SMEs underserved.
- **Wipro**: Offers IT, consulting, and business process services. While Wipro is a leader in the industry, their services are generally designed for larger organizations, with less emphasis on SME-specific needs.

### Competitor Differentiation

- **Accenture**: Offers high-end solutions with a strong emphasis on security and advanced technology, but their services are often priced beyond the reach of many SMEs.
- **Cognizant**: Delivers a broad range of services but tends to offer generic solutions that do not specifically cater to the unique challenges faced by SMEs.
- **Deloitte**: Known for high-quality professional services, but their focus on large enterprises means their offerings are often less accessible to SMEs both in terms of cost and customization.
- **HCL Technologies**: Focuses on cutting-edge technology and innovation, but their high costs and enterprise-centric approach limit their accessibility for SMEs.
- **Infosys**: Provides robust IT solutions with a focus on innovation and efficiency, but their services lack the customization needed to fully support SMEs.

### Leveraging Network Effects to Build a Community of Resellers

## 4. Clear Value for Suppliers

Creating value for suppliers is as important as creating value for customers. Suppliers provide the raw materials, labor, and transportation necessary for your business operations. Supplier surplus, or supplier delight, occurs when the cost of materials increases or their willingness to sell decreases.

Ways to create value for suppliers include:

- Paying more for higher quality materials, which can also increase customer delight and your firm’s margins
- Collaborating with suppliers to increase efficiency, reducing their costs and willingness to sell

## 5. Clear Value for Employees

An effective business strategy must include creating value for employees. Think of your employees as the “suppliers” of intelligence, with their satisfaction being crucial for overall success. Employee satisfaction can be enhanced by raising wages or delivering value through other means, leading to better customer experiences and increased customer delight.

Examples of creating employee value include:

- Offering competitive salaries and bonuses
- Providing ample paid vacation, sick days, and generous parental leave
- Ensuring flexibility in work location, whether remote or hybrid
- Supporting professional development
- Cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace
- Fostering a supportive organizational culture

## 6. Clear Value for the Firm

While creating value for customers, employees, and suppliers, don’t forget the fourth party: your company. By enhancing value for these three groups, you inherently create value for your firm.

To track your progress, establish key performance indicators (KPIs), define success metrics, and plan how you’ll report results over time. Break down each value-creation goal into actionable tasks. For example, what steps are needed to increase employee compensation? Assign responsibilities for each task.

Having clear assignments and metrics for success will ensure a smooth transition from strategy planning to execution.
