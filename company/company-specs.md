# What Is Value-Based Strategy?

Crafting a winning business strategy is all about developing, aligning, and integrating your organization's strategic initiatives to gain a competitive edge in the market. A well-devised business strategy not only provides a clear roadmap for achieving your goals but also ensures your organization can survive and thrive in a dynamic marketplace.

One effective approach is the value-based strategy. This method simplifies strategic planning by using the value stick framework, which hones in on the unique advantages your business offers, making it easier to focus on what truly sets you apart from the competition.

Value-based strategy is a dynamic method where price-setting and resouce allocation is based on the perceived value of the good or service. This approach ensures that prices reflect what customers believe the product or service is worth.

To visualize and optimize this strategy, the value stick framework is invaluable. It helps you see how different factors interact and guides you in choosing initiatives that maximize value for everyone involved.




**The Value Stick Framework**

The value stick consists of four key factors:

1. **Willingness to Pay (WTP):** The highest price a customer is willing to pay for your product or service.
2. **Price:** The actual amount customers pay for your goods or services.
3. **Cost:** The expenses incurred by the company to produce the goods or services.
4. **Willingness to Sell (WTS):** The minimum amount suppliers are willing to accept for the materials needed to produce your goods or services.

By adjusting each factor on the value stick, you can see how it impacts the others and find the optimal way to create value. For example, lowering the price can boost customer satisfaction and increase demand.

As Felix Oberholzer-Gee explains in "Business Strategy," the core questions for strategists are: “How can my business best create value for customers? How can my business create value for employees? And how can my business create value by collaborating with suppliers? A company’s strategy is essentially the answer to these three questions.”
